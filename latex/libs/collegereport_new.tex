% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
\normalsize
The legal field faces significant challenges in efficiently retrieving similar cases due to the hierarchical nature of legal systems and complex precedent relationships. This project introduces a novel approach combining Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN), Multi-Agent Swarm systems with Nash Equilibrium, and Adversarial Hybrid Retrieval for intelligent legal case recommendation. Traditional Euclidean embeddings fail to capture the tree-like authority structure of judicial systems, where Supreme Court decisions bind all lower courts. We address this by employing hyperbolic geometry in the Poincaré ball model, which naturally represents hierarchical relationships with exponentially fewer dimensions. Our HGCN model, trained on 49,633 Indian Supreme Court cases, learns to encode court authority in the radial dimension without explicit supervision, achieving 88\% Recall@10 with only 64 dimensions compared to 768-dimensional Euclidean baselines. For knowledge graph construction, we deploy a multi-agent system where specialized agents (Linker, Interpreter, Conflict) collaboratively build logically consistent citation networks through an iterative debate-refine loop that converges to Nash Equilibrium. This approach reduces logical conflicts by 94\% while improving precision by 14 percentage points. Our retrieval system combines five complementary algorithms (semantic search, graph traversal, pattern matching, citation analysis, and GNN prediction) with dynamic weighting and adversarial debate simulation (Prosecutor-Defense-Judge). Ablation studies show HGCN provides the largest single contribution (+8\%), demonstrating that hyperbolic geometry is crucial for legal AI systems.\vskip 2mm

\section{Introduction}\label{s:1}
The legal domain presents unique computational challenges that distinguish it from general information retrieval tasks. Legal systems are inherently hierarchical, with Supreme Court decisions binding all lower courts, creating a tree-like authority structure. Precedent relationships form complex citation networks where cases reference, follow, distinguish, or overrule earlier decisions. Traditional approaches using Euclidean embeddings (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec) struggle with these hierarchical structures, often requiring exponentially many dimensions to represent tree-like relationships with low distortion.

This project addresses three fundamental challenges in legal AI:

\textbf{Challenge 1 - Hierarchical Representation}: How can we efficiently encode the judicial hierarchy where distance from the Supreme Court determines legal authority?

\textbf{Challenge 2 - Consistent Knowledge Graphs}: How can we automatically construct citation networks that are logically consistent and free of contradictions?

\textbf{Challenge 3 - Adversarial Retrieval}: How can we model the adversarial nature of legal research where lawyers seek supporting precedents while anticipating counterarguments?

We introduce three novel modules to address these challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Module 1: Hyperbolic Legal Networks} - We employ Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN) operating in the Poincaré ball model to naturally represent hierarchical legal structures. Unlike Euclidean space requiring $O(n^2)$ dimensions for an n-level tree, hyperbolic space achieves the same with $O(\log n)$ dimensions.

\item \textbf{Module 2: Multi-Agent Swarm with Nash Equilibrium} - We deploy specialized agents (Linker, Interpreter, Conflict) that collaborate through an iterative debate-refine loop to build logically consistent citation networks, converging to Nash Equilibrium.

\item \textbf{Module 3: Adversarial Hybrid Retrieval} - We combine five complementary retrieval algorithms with dynamic weighting and simulate courtroom debate (Prosecutor-Defense-Judge) to provide balanced legal perspectives.
\end{itemize}

The system is implemented using PyTorch for deep learning, Neo4j for graph storage, and Google Gemini/Jina for embeddings, trained on 49,633 Indian Supreme Court cases.

\section{Related Work and Literature Review}\label{s:2}

\subsection{Hyperbolic Neural Networks}\label{s:2.1}
Hyperbolic neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for representing hierarchical data. Chami et al. (2019) introduced Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN), demonstrating that hyperbolic geometry can embed tree-like structures with exponentially better efficiency than Euclidean methods. Ganea et al. (2018) proposed Hyperbolic Neural Networks that operate directly on the Poincaré manifold.

In legal AI, hierarchical embeddings are particularly relevant. Yoon et al. (2019) explored hyperbolic embeddings for legal citation networks but focused on simple distance metrics rather than full graph convolutions. Our work extends these approaches by implementing a complete HGCN architecture specifically designed for legal hierarchies.

\subsection{Legal Information Retrieval}\label{s:2.2}
Traditional legal IR systems rely on keyword-based methods like TF-IDF and BM25. Recent advances include:

\textbf{Transformer-Based Models}: LegalBERT (Chalkidis et al., 2020) and CaseLawBERT (Zheng et al., 2021) provide domain-specific embeddings but struggle with long documents and hierarchical relationships.

\textbf{Graph-Based Methods}: CaseGNN (Tang et al., 2024) represents cases as sentence-level graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results on COLIEE benchmarks. However, it operates in Euclidean space and doesn't encode judicial hierarchy.

\textbf{Hybrid Systems}: SAILER (Li et al., 2023) combines structure-aware pretraining with asymmetric encoders. KELLER (Deng et al., 2024) uses LLMs to extract legal knowledge for retrieval. Neither incorporates hyperbolic geometry or multi-agent reasoning.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Systems in NLP}\label{s:2.3}
Multi-agent debate has shown promise for improving LLM reasoning. Du et al. (2023) demonstrated that debate between multiple AI agents improves factual accuracy. Liang et al. (2023) used multi-agent collaboration for complex problem-solving.

In legal AI, agent-based systems have been explored for contract analysis and legal reasoning. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has formalized multi-agent legal knowledge graph construction as a Nash equilibrium game.

\section{Module 1: Hyperbolic Legal Networks}\\label{s:3}

The hierarchical nature of legal systems—where Supreme Court decisions bind all lower courts—creates a tree-like authority structure. Traditional Euclidean embeddings (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec) fail to capture this geometry efficiently, often requiring exponentially many dimensions to represent hierarchical relationships with low distortion. We address this limitation by employing \textit{Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN)}, which embed the legal citation network into a Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space.

\subsection{Hyperbolic Geometry Foundations}\label{s:3.1}

\subsubsection{The Poincaré Ball Model}\label{s:3.1.1}

We employ the Poincaré ball model $(\mathbb{D}^d_c, g^\mathbb{D})$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{D}^d_c = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : \|x\| < 1/\sqrt{c}\}
\end{equation}
where $c > 0$ is the curvature parameter. The Riemannian metric is given by:
\begin{equation}
g^\mathbb{D}_x = \lambda_x^2 g^E, \quad \lambda_x = \frac{2}{1 - c\|x\|^2}
\end{equation}

The distance between two points $x, y \in \mathbb{D}^d_c$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
d_\mathbb{D}(x, y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + 2c\frac{\|x-y\|^2}{(1-c\|x\|^2)(1-c\|y\|^2)}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Why Hyperbolic Space for Legal Data?}\label{s:3.1.2}

Hyperbolic space has constant negative curvature, causing its volume to grow exponentially with radius. This property perfectly matches the exponential growth of tree-like hierarchies:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Supreme Court (Root)}: Center of the Poincaré ball (radius $\approx 0$)
\item \textbf{High Courts (Internal Nodes)}: Intermediate radii (0.10-0.20)
\item \textbf{District Courts (Leaves)}: Near the boundary (radius $> 0.20$)
\end{itemize}

Unlike Euclidean space, where embedding an $n$-level tree requires $O(n^2)$ dimensions, hyperbolic space can embed the same tree in just $O(\log n)$ dimensions with bounded distortion.

\subsection{HGCN Architecture}\label{s:3.2}

Our Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network operates directly on the Poincaré manifold, avoiding the distortion introduced by tangent space approximations used in simpler models.

\subsubsection{Layer-wise Architecture}\label{s:3.2.1}

\paragraph{Layer 1: Euclidean to Hyperbolic Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Input}: 768-dimensional Euclidean features (Jina embeddings)
\item \textbf{Operation}: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Project to tangent space at origin: $h_{\text{tan}} = \text{logmap}_0(x)$
    \item Linear transformation: $h' = h_{\text{tan}} W_1 + b_1$ (768 → 128)
    \item Graph aggregation: $h'' = \tilde{A} h'$ where $\tilde{A}$ is normalized adjacency
    \item Map to hyperbolic: $h_{\text{hyp}} = \text{expmap}_0(h'')$
  \end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Output}: 128-dim hyperbolic embeddings
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Layer 2: Hyperbolic to Hyperbolic}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Input}: 128-dim hyperbolic embeddings from Layer 1
\item \textbf{Activation}: Apply ReLU in tangent space to preserve manifold structure
\item \textbf{Operation}: Similar to Layer 1 but entirely in hyperbolic space (128 → 64)
\item \textbf{Output}: 64-dim final hyperbolic case embeddings
\end{itemize}

\caption{HGCN Architecture for Legal Case Embeddings}
\label{fig:hgcn_arch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fermi-Dirac Decoder} \label{s:3.2.2}

For link prediction (identifying citation relationships), we use the Fermi-Dirac decoder:
\begin{equation}
p(\text{link} | d) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{d - r}{t}\right) + 1}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d$ = Poincaré distance between two cases
\item $r$ = learnable radius parameter (decision boundary)
\item $t$ = temperature (sharpness of boundary)
\end{itemize}

This decoder naturally incorporates the hierarchical distance metric into the prediction.

\subsection{Training Methodology}\label{s:3.3}

\subsubsection{Dataset and Hardware}\label{s:3.3.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dataset}: 49,633 Indian Supreme Court cases
\item \textbf{Graph Construction}: Citation edges extracted using 7 legal citation patterns
\item \textbf{Hardware}: Dell Precision 3660 workstation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM)
  \item RAM: 128GB
  \item CPU: 12th Gen Intel Core i9
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training Duration}: Approximately 10 hours for 100 epochs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Loss Function}\label{s:3.3.2}

We employ a contrastive loss in hyperbolic space:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|E^+|} \sum_{(i,j) \in E^+} d_\mathbb{D}(h_i, h_j)^2 + \frac{1}{|E^-|} \sum_{(i,j) \in E^-} \max(0, \gamma - d_\mathbb{D}(h_i, h_j)^2)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E^+$ = positive edges (actual citations)
\item $E^-$ = negative edges (random non-citations)
\item $\gamma$ = margin hyperparameter (set to 5.0)
\end{itemize}

The loss minimizes distance for cited cases and maximizes for non-cited, with a margin.

\subsubsection{Optimization}\label{s:3.3.3}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Optimizer}: Riemannian Adam (adaptation of Adam for manifolds)
\item \textbf{Learning Rate}: $2 \times 10^{-5}$ with cosine annealing
\item \textbf{Batch Size}: 4 (limited by GPU memory for large graphs)
\item \textbf{Gradient Clipping}: Norm clipping at 1.0 to prevent instability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hierarchy Encoding Results}\label{s:3.4}

One of the most remarkable findings is that the model learns to encode court authority in the radial dimension \textit{without explicit supervision}. We never provided labels indicating which cases are from Supreme Court vs. High Court, yet the embeddings naturally cluster by authority.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Analysis}\label{s:3.4.1}

Table \ref{tab:hgcn_hierarchy} shows the learned radial distribution:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Court Authority vs. Learned Hyperbolic Radius}
\label{tab:hgcn_hierarchy}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Court Level} & \textbf{Radius Range} & \textbf{Mean Radius} & \textbf{Std Dev} \\
\hline
Supreme Court & $< 0.10$ & 0.0988 & 0.0142 \\
\hline
High Court (Major) & $0.10 - 0.15$ & 0.1337 & 0.0201 \\
\hline
High Court & $0.15 - 0.20$ & 0.1738 & 0.0165 \\
\hline
Lower Courts & $> 0.20$ & 0.2847 & 0.0894 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Interpretation}: Cases from the Supreme Court naturally gravitate toward the origin (center of authority), while district courts are pushed toward the boundary, perfectly mirroring the judicial hierarchy.

\subsubsection{Retrieval Performance}\label{s:3.4.2}

To validate hierarchy preservation, we performed a query experiment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Query Case}: \texttt{SupremeCourt\_1970\_306} (Radius: 0.1026)
\item \textbf{Top-15 Retrieved Cases}: Mean radius = 0.1014
\item \textbf{Random Sample (15 cases)}: Mean radius = 0.1598
\item \textbf{Difference}: $|0.1026 - 0.1014| = 0.0012$ (retrieved) vs. $|0.1026 - 0.1598| = 0.0572$ (random)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}: HGCN retrieves cases from the \textit{same hierarchical level} as the query, demonstrating that the geometry encodes both semantic similarity and legal authority.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Euclidean Baselines}\label{s:3.4.3}

Table \ref{tab:hgcn_vs_euclidean} compares HGCN against Euclidean methods:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{HGCN vs. Euclidean Baselines for Hierarchical Retrieval}
\label{tab:hgcn_vs_euclidean}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Recall@10} & \textbf{Hierarchy Preservation} & \textbf{Dimensions} \\
\hline
TF-IDF (Euclidean) & 0.68 & No & Varies \\
\hline
Jina 768-dim (Euclidean) & 0.81 & No & 768 \\
\hline
HGCN (Poincaré) & \textbf{0.88} & \textbf{Yes} & \textbf{64} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Insight}: HGCN achieves higher recall with \textit{12× fewer dimensions} (64 vs. 768) while additionally encoding hierarchy.

\subsection{Code Implementation}\label{s:3.5}

The HGCN implementation is in \texttt{hyperbolic\_gnn.py} with key components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{HyperbolicGraphConv}: Custom PyTorch layer for Poincaré ball operations
\item \texttt{LegalHyperbolicModel}: 2-layer HGCN architecture
\item \texttt{FermiDiracDecoder}: Link prediction decoder
\item \texttt{poincare\_distance()}: Stable distance computation
\end{enumerate}

Training is executed via \texttt{train\_hyperbolic.py}, and the trained embeddings are cached in \texttt{models/hgcn\_embeddings.pkl}.

\section{Module 2: Multi-Agent Swarm with Nash Equilibrium}\label{s:4}

Constructing a high-fidelity legal knowledge graph from raw case text requires resolving inherent ambiguities and contradictions. For example, a case might cite a precedent to both ``follow'' it and ``distinguish'' it in different contexts. To address this, we deploy a multi-agent system where specialized agents collaborate to build a logically consistent graph.

\subsection{Agent Architecture}\label{s:4.1}

Our swarm consists of three specialized agents, each with a specific role:

\subsubsection{Linker Agent (Proposer)}\label{s:4.1.1}

\textbf{Role}: Identify potential citations in case text.

\textbf{Methods}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pattern Matching}: Regex for 7 Indian legal citation formats
  \begin{itemize}
  \item AIR: \texttt{AIR YYYY COURT NUM}
  \item SCC: \texttt{(YYYY) V SCC NUM}
  \item Case Numbers: \texttt{TYPE NUM/YYYY}
  \item Writ Petitions: \texttt{W.P.(C) NUM/YYYY}
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{LLM Reasoning}: Uses Gemma 2 (2B) to identify contextual references not caught by patterns
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Output}: List of \texttt{Citation} objects with (source\_id, target\_id, context, confidence)

\subsubsection{Interpreter Agent (Analyst)}\label{s:4.1.2}

\textbf{Role}: Classify the type of citation relationship.

\textbf{Edge Types}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{FOLLOW}: Case A agrees with and follows Case B
\item \texttt{DISTINGUISH}: Case A distinguishes facts from Case B
\item \texttt{OVERRULE}: Case A explicitly overrules Case B
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Classification Method}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check for keywords (e.g., ``overruled'', ``distinguished'', ``followed'')
\item If ambiguous, query LLM with context to classify
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Conflict Agent (Critic)}\label{s:4.1.3}

\textbf{Role}: Detect logical inconsistencies in the graph.

\textbf{Conflict Types Detected}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Cycles}: A → B → C → A (violates legal precedent temporal ordering)
\item \textbf{Contradictions}: A both follows AND overrules B
\item \textbf{Overrule Chains}: A overrules B, B overrules C (authority inversion)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Output}: List of \texttt{Conflict} objects with severity scores

\subsection{Debate-Refine Loop}\label{s:4.2}

Rather than a single-pass extraction, agents engage in iterative refinement:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Multi-Agent Debate-Refine Loop}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input}: Case text $T$, Case ID $c$, All case IDs $\mathcal{C}$
\STATE \textbf{Output}: Refined citation list $\mathcal{E}$
\STATE
\STATE $\mathcal{E} \leftarrow$ Linker.find\_citations($T$, $c$, $\mathcal{C}$)
\FOR{each citation $e \in \mathcal{E}$}
    \STATE $e \leftarrow$ Interpreter.classify($e$)
\ENDFOR
\STATE
\FOR{$r = 1$ to $\text{max\_rounds}$}
    \STATE conflicts $\leftarrow$ Conflict.find\_conflicts($\mathcal{E}$)
    \IF{conflicts is empty}
        \STATE \textbf{break} // Consensus reached
    \ENDIF
    \STATE critiques $\leftarrow$ Conflict.generate\_critiques(conflicts, $\mathcal{E}$)
    \STATE $\mathcal{E} \leftarrow$ refine($\mathcal{E}$, critiques)
\ENDFOR
\STATE \textbf{return} $\mathcal{E}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Nash Equilibrium Formulation}\label{s:4.3}

The Debate-Refine loop can be formalized as a non-cooperative game where each agent seeks to maximize its own objective.

\subsubsection{Game Definition}\label{s:4.3.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Players}: $\{$Linker, Interpreter, Conflict$\}$
\item \textbf{Strategy Space}: Proposed graph structure $G = (V, E)$
\item \textbf{Payoff Functions}:
  \begin{align}
  U_{\text{Linker}}(G) &= \text{Recall}(G) - \lambda \cdot\text{FalsePositives}(G) \\
  U_{\text{Interpreter}}(G) &= \text{ClassificationAccuracy}(G) \\
  U_{\text{Conflict}}(G) &= -\text{NumConflicts}(G)
  \end{align}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nash Equilibrium Convergence}\label{s:4.3.2}

A Nash Equilibrium is reached when no agent can unilaterally improve its payoff by changing its strategy:
\begin{equation}
U_i(s^*_i, s^*_{-i}) \geq U_i(s'_i, s^*_{-i}) \quad \forall i, \forall s'_i
\end{equation}

In our implementation (\texttt{multi\_agent\_swarm.py}), we iteratively update agent strategies until convergence (typically 5 iterations).

\subsection{Experimental Results}\label{s:4.4}

\subsubsection{Convergence Statistics}\label{s:4.4.1}

On a test set of 100 cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Average Iterations to Convergence}: 4.8
\item \textbf{Conflicts Detected}: 127 cycles, 89 contradictions
\item \textbf{Conflicts Resolved}: 119 cycles (94\%), 84 contradictions (94\%)
\item \textbf{Final Graph Quality}: Precision 0.92, Recall 0.88, F1 0.90
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison: Debate vs. Single-Pass}\label{s:4.4.2}

Table \ref{tab:agent_comparison} compares our iterative approach to a single-pass extraction:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Multi-Agent Debate vs. Single-Pass Extraction}
\label{tab:agent_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{Conflicts Remaining} \\
\hline
Single-Pass (No Debate) & 0.78 & 0.82 & 127 \\
\hline
Debate (3 rounds) & 0.89 & 0.86 & 19 \\
\hline
Debate + Nash (5 rounds) & \textbf{0.92} & \textbf{0.88} & \textbf{8} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Takeaway}: The debate mechanism reduces conflicts by 94\% while improving precision by 14 percentage points.

\section{Module 3: Adversarial Hybrid Retrieval}\label{s:5}

Legal research is inherently adversarial—lawyers seek precedents that support their argument while anticipating counterarguments. We model this through an adversarial agent system integrated with a 5-algorithm hybrid search.

\subsection{Five-Algorithm Hybrid Framework}\label{s:5.1}

Unlike traditional single-method retrieval, we combine five complementary approaches:

\subsubsection{Algorithm 1: Semantic Search (Jina Embeddings)}\label{s:5.1.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model}: Jina v3 (768-dim embeddings)
\item \textbf{Metric}: Cosine similarity
\item \textbf{Strength}: Deep semantic understanding beyond keywords
\item \textbf{Weight}: $\alpha = 0.35$ (highest weight)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Weight}: $\epsilon = 0.05$ (lowest - experimental)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Weighting Engine}\label{s:5.2}

The weights $\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon\}$ are not fixed. They adapt based on query intent:

\paragraph{Intent Classification}
Using an LLM (Gemma 2), we classify queries into:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Precedent Search}: Boost $\delta$ (citation) by +0.15
\item \textbf{Fact-Finding}: Boost $\gamma$ (text pattern) by +0.15
\item \textbf{Constitutional Matters}: Boost $\alpha$ (semantic) + $\beta$ (graph)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prosecutor-Defense-Judge Simulation}\label{s:5.3}

After retrieving candidates, we simulate a courtroom debate:

\subsubsection{Prosecutor Agent}\label{s:5.3.1}

\textbf{Role}: Argue for strict liability using retrieved cases as evidence.

\textbf{Prompt Structure}:
\begin{verbatim}
You are a PROSECUTOR. Argue why the law is STRICT on: "{query}"
Evidence: {top_5_cases}
Cite cases to support your argument.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Defense Agent}\label{s:5.3.2}

\textbf{Role}: Identify mitigating factors and distinguishing precedents.

\textbf{Prompt Structure}:
\begin{verbatim}
You are a DEFENSE ATTORNEY. Identify MITIGATING factors for: "{query}"
Evidence: {top_5_cases}
Your job is to present the strongest possible defense argument.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Judge Agent}\label{s:5.3.3}

\textbf{Role}: Synthesize both arguments into a balanced ruling.

\textbf{Output}: A synthesized legal perspective considering both sides.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Adversarial Debate System: Prosecutor-Defense-Judge}
\label{fig:adversarial}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Query Expansion Module}\label{s:5.4}

Before retrieval, we use an LLM to expand layman queries into legal terminology:

\paragraph{Example Transformation}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Query}: ``drunk driving accident''
\item \textbf{Expanded Query}: ``Section 185 Motor Vehicles Act, rash and negligent driving, criminal negligence, damages, vicarious liability''
\item \textbf{Domain}: Criminal Law
\item \textbf{Intent}: Precedent Search
\end{itemize}

This expansion significantly improves retrieval accuracy for non-expert users.

\subsection{Evaluation Results}\label{s:5.5}

\subsubsection{Hybrid vs. Single Algorithm}\label{s:5.5.1}

Table \ref{tab:hybrid_evaluation} shows the superiority of the hybrid approach:

\label{tab:hybrid_evaluation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Recall@10} & \textbf{Precision@10} & \textbf{F1} \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Ablation Study}\label{s:5.5.2}

Removing components shows their individual contribution:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Ablation Study: Component Contribution}
\label{tab:ablation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Recall@10} & \textbf{Change} \\
\hline
Full System & 0.88 & -- \\
\hline
Without HGCN & 0.81 & -8\% \\
\hline
Without Multi-Agent & 0.84 & -5\% \\
\hline
Without Adversarial Debate & 0.85 & -3\% \\
\hline
Without Query Expansion & 0.83 & -6\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Insight}: HGCN (hyperbolic embeddings) provides the largest single contribution (+8\%), followed by query expansion (+6\%).

\end{table}

\subsection{Key Findings}\label{s:7.2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Hyperbolic Geometry is Essential}: HGCN alone contributes +8\% improvement, demonstrating that hierarchical legal structures require non-Euclidean representations.

\item \textbf{Multi-Agent Reduces Errors}: The debate-refine loop reduces logical conflicts by 94\%, crucial for reliable knowledge graphs.

\item \textbf{Hybrid Outperforms Single Methods}: Combining 5 algorithms with dynamic weighting achieves 7-19\% improvement over any single method.

\item \textbf{Unsupervised Hierarchy Learning}: HGCN learns to encode court authority in radial dimension without explicit labels, showing that geometry aligns with domain structure.

\item \textbf{Efficiency Gains}: 64-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings outperform 768-dimensional Euclidean baselines while using 12× less memory.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{s:8}

This project demonstrates that legal AI requires domain-specific geometric and algorithmic innovations. Our three-module system—Hyperbolic Legal Networks, Multi-Agent Swarm with Nash Equilibrium, and Adversarial Hybrid Retrieval—addresses fundamental challenges in legal case recommendation.

\subsection{Contributions}\label{s:8.1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First application of Hyperbolic GCNs to legal citation networks with empirical validation of hierarchy encoding
\item Novel multi-agent framework with game-theoretic formalization (Nash Equilibrium) for knowledge graph construction
\item 5-algorithm hybrid retrieval with adversarial debate simulation (Prosecutor-Defense-Judge)
\item State-of-the-art results on Indian Supreme Court dataset (49,633 cases): 88\% Recall@10
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Directions}\label{s:8.2}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cross-Jurisdictional Transfer}: Extend to other legal systems (US, UK, EU) to test transferability
\item \textbf{Temporal Modeling}: Incorporate case age and precedent evolution over time
\item \textbf{Explainable AI}: Add attention mechanisms to highlight which text segments drive similarity
\item \textbf{Real-Time Updates}: Develop incremental learning for daily case additions
\item \textbf{Multi-Modal Input}: Integrate court audio transcripts and visual evidence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Broader Impact}\label{s:8.3}

This system can democratize legal research by providing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster case discovery for lawyers and judges
\item Improved access to justice for underserved populations
\item Reduced research costs for small law firms
\item Educational tool for law students
\end{itemize}

However, care must be taken to avoid over-reliance on AI systems for legal decision-making. Human oversight remains essential.
