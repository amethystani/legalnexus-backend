  "content": "In the significant case of Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgment on the admissibility of electronic records, particularly CDs and other digital evidence, in court proceedings. The Court comprehensively examined Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which deals with the admissibility of electronic records.\n\nThe case involved an election dispute where the petitioner sought to rely on certain electronic evidence, including CDs containing audio recordings, to prove allegations of corrupt practices. The primary issue before the Court was whether a certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act was mandatory for the admissibility of electronic evidence.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that any documentary evidence by way of electronic records under the Evidence Act can be proved only in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. The Court clarified that Section 65B is a special provision that overrides the general law on secondary evidence under Section 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act.\n\nThe Court specifically addressed the issue of CDs as evidence, ruling that when a CD is presented as primary evidence, it must be accompanied by a certificate under Section 65B(4) attesting to the satisfaction of the conditions mentioned in Section 65B(2). This certificate must identify the electronic record, describe the manner of its production, furnish particulars of the device used, and confirm compliance with all necessary conditions.\n\nThe three-judge bench, comprising Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice R.F. Nariman, and Justice U.U. Lalit, clarified that without such a certificate, electronic evidence cannot be admitted as evidence. The Court explicitly overruled its previous judgment in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, which had held that electronic evidence could be proved through oral evidence even without a certificate.\n\nJustice Kurian Joseph, writing for the bench, observed: \"Any documentary evidence by way of an electronic record under the Evidence Act, in view of Sections 59 and 65A, can be proved only in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. Section 65B deals with the admissibility of the electronic record. The purpose of these provisions is to sanctify secondary evidence in electronic form, generated by a computer.\"\n\nThis case has had profound implications for criminal trials in India, particularly those involving digital evidence stored on CDs, DVDs, hard disks, or other electronic media. The judgment established strict procedural requirements for the admission of such evidence, ensuring their authenticity and reliability while preventing manipulation or tampering.\n\nIn conclusion, the Anvar P.V. case set a definitive standard for the admissibility of CDs and other electronic evidence in Indian courts, emphasizing the mandatory requirement of certification under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act. This judgment continues to guide courts in handling digital evidence in an era where electronic records are increasingly becoming central to litigation.",
