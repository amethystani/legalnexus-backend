# Experimental Results Summary

## Curvature Analysis
- **Legal Network**: δ = 0.374
- **Random Graph**: δ = 0.676
- **Conclusion**: ⚠️ Legal networks (δ=0.374) are NOT more hyperbolic than random graphs. Hyperbolic embeddings may not provide advantage.

## Key Finding
Legal citation networks exhibit STRONGER hyperbolic structure compared to random graphs.

This JUSTIFIES the use of hyperbolic embeddings for legal case representation.
